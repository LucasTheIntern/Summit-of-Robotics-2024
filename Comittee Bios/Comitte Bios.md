# Lucas Duncan
Hello! I'm a second-year PhD student from CU Boulder. I spend most of my week working in the Animal Inspired Movement and Robotics Laboratory (AIMRL) on main campus, where I work with insect-scale robots. My research focus is in controls and autonomy, but I also enjoy dabbling in hardware and mechanics!  
Have you ever noticed that fireflies (aka lightning bugs) are somewhat scarce in Colorado? I have! I am working with a CS lab on east campus to study these fragile fairies of the insect world. I've written a lot of useful code that allows researchers to observe and interact with various species of fireflies using a tiny quadcopter that fits in the palm of your hand.  
Fireflies are quite rare in Colorado due to destruction of habitat, pesticides, and other human activities. I miss the massive, magical swarms of fireflies that illuminate the night skies back in Ohio!  
Speaking of Ohio... That's my home state. I also did my undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering there through Sinclair Community College and Wright State University. My degree track focused on materials and design, and landed a two-year internship at the Air Force Research Lab. My research there was focused on novel additive manufacturing processes for laser-powder-bed-fusion techniques. That's also when I really started writing a LOT of code, and was recognized as being rather good at it... So... here I am!
