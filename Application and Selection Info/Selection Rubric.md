Hi there!

We're looking for students who are passionate about robotics! Want to join us?

First off, there are only 52 in-person spaces available, a few of which are already filled by the committee members and attending faculty/professionals. Anyone who can't attend in person will be able to join us remotely for presentations and workshops!

Secondly, student attendance will be split to approximately 80% grad students and 20% undergraduate students. 

Third, we're hoping to get relatively equal participation from students across a variety of majors related to robotics. ME, EE, CS, Mechatronics, and Aerospace students are all welcome! If you belong to a different major that you feel is relevant, feel free to apply!

In addition, we hope that you will be available for all three days of the retreat! 

We'll also ask you to provide some short text describing your passion for robotics supported with examples. We're not too focused on finding individuals with lots of experience, so be prepared to tell us about anything you've done that demonstrates your passion for the field, especially in community or teaching contexts!

Thanks for checking us out! We hope to see you at the retreat!
